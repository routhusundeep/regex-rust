This motivation behind this project to help me learn Rust, I dont want to write some generic contrived examples which only teaches you the languages features at surface level, So I searched for some use cases which I am already familiar with and use on a daily basis, so that I can dive in right ahead without bothering to learn the domain too. Finally I have decided on Regular Expressions, they looked complex enough to make me use obscure and advanced features of Rust.

Lot of code is refererred from [regex crate](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/)


I am following these articles for NFA implementations
- [Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html)
- [Regular Expression Matching: the Virtual Machine Approach](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html)
