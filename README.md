This motivation behind this project to help me learn Rust, I dont want to write some generic contrived examples which only teaches you the languages features at surface level, So I searched for some use cases which I am already familiar with and use on a daily basis, so that I can dive in right ahead without bothering to learn the domain too. Finally I have decided on Regular Expressions, they looked complex enough to make me use obscure and advanced features of Rust.

I will try to use as many features of Rust as possible, performance playing a smaller role in the intial stages.
I am following this [paper](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html).
